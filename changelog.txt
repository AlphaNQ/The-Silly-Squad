  - 1 in 8 chance to turn scored cards into Aces.
  - 1 in 15 chance to give scored Aces the Kit's favor.

- Adds the Kit's Favour Seal.
  - Retriggers Played Card 5 times.

both additions are cosmetic at the moment and have no calculate functions. 

V 0.1.1

- Made the Heavenly Kitsune Joker reference "Kit's Favour" instead of "Burned" because im a fucking idiot.

- fixed Kit's Favour text for variable number to be highlighted with {C:attention} instead of {C:green}
  in order to keep consistency with the original game.

- Reformatted Burned Seal text simply for aestetics :3

V 0.1.2

- Added calculate funciton for Kit's Favour Seal.

V 0.1.3

- Added calculate function for Heavenly Kitsune Joker card.

- Fixed a bug where Flame Noble's "Burned!" Text would pop up despite no cards being affected.

- Tweaked the Flame Noble Joker card to not reaply the Burned seal on cards that already have it.

V 0.1.3a

- Added Credits tab.

- Added French Translation.

- Finished half of Heavenly Kitsune's calculate funciton. other half currently under production.

V 0.1.3b

- Finished the other half of Heavenly Kitsune's calculate function. Still many minor bugs to patch though.

V 0.2.0 /// Jackalope Expansion

- Added Arcane-nine Joker card (currently cosmetic, no calculate function)
  - Scored aces give X2 Mult
  - Gains X0.5 Mult for every 10 Aces

V 0.2.1

- Added calculate funciton to Arcane-nine

- Added Arcane-nine's French localization

PLANS:

  - Changing Kit's Favour from Seal to Sticker to allow for both Burned Seal and Kit's Favour to appear on the same card.
    only thing currently stopping me is how much of a pain debugging will be without the ability to manualy add the seal.

V 0.2.2

- Adjusted card exclusion on Flame Noble and Heavenly Kitsune to include eachother's seals.

- attempting to fix a bug with Arcane-nine that doesnt reset the count, causing it to repeatedly upgrade after a single set of ten Aces.
  currently no luck.

V 0.3.0 /// Funny Expansion :3

- Added Quick Fox Joker card
  - spawns a "random" Tarot card when least scored hand is played 🙂

- Added a Caption variable for extra flare in card descriptions :3

V 0.3.1 /// FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE

- Setup mod's official Github page.

- Added Quick Fox's French localization.

V 0.3.2

- Fixed mod atlases to be more organised, leading to better preformance (not like it'll be noticable anyway).

- Added disclaimers to joker cards because the visuals are, very obviously, not done yet.

- Added Quick Fox's calculate function.
  to be clear, none of it works yet, and i dont know how to fix it at the moment. but it is there :3
