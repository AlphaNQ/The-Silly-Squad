## Current Content
**7 New Jokers**:
each joker represents us and our ocs as people along with a few inside jokes:
- Flame Noble                 [Uncommon]
  - 1 in 5 chance to apply the Burned Seal to scored cards
- Heavenly Kitsune            [Rare]
  - 1 in 8 chance to turn scored cards into Aces
  - 1 in 16 chance to give scored Aces the Kit's Favour
- Arcane-nine                 [Rare]
  - Scored Aces give X2 Mult
  - Gains X0.5 Mult for every 10 Aces
- Quick Fox                   [Common]
  - spawns a *"random"* Tarot card when Least scored hand is played
- Roulette                    [Rare]
  - Random chance to act as either Flame Noble, Heavenly Kitsune, Arcane-nine or Quick Fox
- Bubblegum                   [Legendary]
  - X0.2 mult for every follower on Alpha's BlueSky Account
  (This is a blatant copy of the Elle card from "[ellejokers.](https://github.com/ellestuff/ellejokers)". that is the entire joke about this card, and she knew of this before I even published this card in update 0.4.0.)
- **And more!!**

**2 New Seals**: Of course we cant just have jokers that dont do *something* funky to other cards, so we have two seals that get applied using two of the four jokers. (please note one of them will be turned into a sticker later down the line)
- Burned Seal
  - -10 Mult, x4 Mult
  - cards with this seal will be Burnt away(destroyed) after scoring 5 times
- Kit's Favour
  - Cards retrigger 5 times

**2 New Vouchers**: with such silly cards, it'd be a missed opportunity if you couldnt get them naturally, so let's balance that a bit :3
- Cosmic
  - Legendary Jokers spawn 2x more frequently
- Void
  - Legendary Jokers spawn 4x more frequently

NOTE: These Vouchers will not appear if you do not have the [ellejokers. mod](https://github.com/ellestuff/ellejokers) installed.

**A New Boss Blind**: made as a counter to some more... *broken* synergies
- The "F" Student
  - All Ace cards are debuffed

- **And more down the line :3**

## FAQ:
*"Why is the earliest version of this mod V 0.3.1?"*

I've been hesitating to upload this to Github since i started development, fearing it's not good enough to be part of any "official" project of mine, but after a while of expanding on it, i decided why not! Sorry to say all previous versions of this mod before 0.3.1 are unplayable, but i do still have a changelog of everything because i wanted to be very meticulous about documenting my progress :3

*"I want to use some of your code to learn for myself, is that chill?"*

Yeah dude, by all means go ahead! Coding as an entire industry is built on copying and pasting from more experienced people, so it'd be unconstitutional for me to deny you your birthright as an aspiring programmer! Hell, you even have full permission to DM me on any of my socials if you're confused about anything i made and how it was done! Please, do literally any of this! **Just dont. use. ChatGPT.**

*"How much have you thought of balancing this mod?"*

Not at all! :D

This is a dumb mod made by a dumb fuck and her dumb fucks for dumb reasons. This entire mod is made for fun and composed almost entirely of me, my friends and my partners saying "Wouldn't it be funny if ___?" and i decided to **WRITE** THAT SHIT!
if you care about a balanced experience and dont like fun, leave now >:C

*"I found a bug, what do I do?"*

ah good, thank you so much! dont hesitate to DM me on any of my listed socials below and tell me about it! dont be scared, i dont bite :3
